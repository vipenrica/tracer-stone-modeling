Models of tracer stone dispersal and (most of the) data used for validation 

Here you can find 
1) the model used for the validation at laboratory scale
2) the model used for the application on Halfmoon Creek, Colorado, USA
3) the model used for the application on the Buech River, France
4) data of the Wong et al. (2007) laboratory experiments. The data should also be stored on the data repository of the
   National Center for Earth Surface Dyanmics at the University of Mimnnesota, Minneapolis. Courtesy of Miguel Wong. 
6) comparison between model simulations and Wong et al. data 
7) data on tracer stone dispersal collected on the Buech River. Courtesy of Guillaume Brousse.
